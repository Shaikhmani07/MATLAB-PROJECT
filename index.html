  Its a MATLAB project "DUAL TONE MULTIPLE FREQUENCY Decoder (DTMF)" In this project, We have designed a keypad in MATLAB using the GUI functionality of MATLAB. After designing the keypad, I have assigned a tune to each of these buttons. Obviously the tune attached to each button is different and when we press any of these buttons, then the MATLAB recognizes the respective button.This project is designed in MATLAB and I have tested it on MATLAB 2009 and MATLAB 2014 and it works fine on both of them.
